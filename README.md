Hello, world. This code needs a lot of help. But, if you want to give it a go, you need to install the requirements in requirements.txt 
by creating an environment with conda or venv.

You also need your OpenAI API key to put it in your bashrc or equivalent file.

Otherwise, in your root folder of this project run in a terminal window.

make start

Then go to localhost http://localhost:9000/ and can chat with Dr Chattie.
